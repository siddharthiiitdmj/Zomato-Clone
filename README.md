# Zomato-Clone
  -> This is a ongoing project.
  -> It is a full stack project where I will clone the zomato web app completely.<br />
  -> The backend is being built on node/express js using javascript. <br />
  -> I will be building a complete API for the project and build a database on MongoDB server and AWS server.<br />
  -> The frontend will be build on reactjs with the help of tailwind, redux, react hooks, react router dom and postman for API calls.<br />
